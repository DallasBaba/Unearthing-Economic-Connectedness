# Leveraging Social Capital for Economic Connectedness
## Insights from the 2024 AMIS National Competitions

The Association for Management Information Systems (AMIS) has extended an exciting opportunity for us to participate in the 2024 AMIS National Competitions, hosted by the University of Utah AIS Student Chapter. This unique opportunity allows us to showcase our contributions toward Social Capital Development, with a specific focus on enhancing Economic Integration.

Before delving into the details, we express our heartfelt gratitude to all Friends of Public Policy, Social Capital Advocates, and Researchers who have consistently contributed to the field of Social Capital Development.

We also extend a special thank you to Opportunity Insights - Social Capital Atlas and a resounding applause to Raj Chetty and his team for their groundbreaking research paper on Social Capital, introducing the novel concept of “Economic Connectedness.”

## Understanding Economic Connectedness
Economic connectedness refers to the degree to which individuals, institutions, and neighborhoods are economically intertwined. It encompasses the networks, friendships, and collaborations that facilitate economic opportunities and upward mobility.

## Our Mission: Analyzing Social Capital
Our team, “The University of Memphis - AMIS Member,” has been assigned the critical task of analyzing the Social Capital dataset developed by Meta. This dataset features information on a staggering 21 billion friendships. Our primary goal is to uncover insights into economic connectedness and social cohesion. To achieve this, we will leverage Data Engineering skills and machine learning techniques.

## Actionable Strategies for Community Leaders and Policymakers
Our study methodically examines social interactions across diverse demographics and educational settings. By identifying patterns and correlations, we aim to provide actionable recommendations for community leaders, policymakers, and educational institutions. These strategies will enhance economic integration and uplift local communities.

We believe that even small, measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can make a significant impact.

Let’s harness the power of Social Capital to foster economic connectedness and create a stronger, more resilient community.
